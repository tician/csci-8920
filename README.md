Environmental Text Enhanced Mixture Monte Carlo Localization

Description
-----
Final project for CSCI-8920 "Decision Making Under Uncertainty".
Failed to complete within time limit.

Features
-----
- Work-In-Progress.
- Uses the "read\_text" detector created by Menglong Zhu as part of "literate\_pr2" package (already made this 'wet', but have not uploaded that yet).
- Failed to comprehend the amcl ROS node, so tried to implement my own particle filter.
- After stand-alone program becomes functional, will export to ros nodes/packages.
